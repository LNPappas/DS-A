#When to use each sort algorithm:

# Merge Sort: large amounts of data

# Quick Sort: less space

# Insertion Sort: fast on small amounts of data, easy to code, space complexity = O(1)
    #of large amounts of data that are already pre-sorted. 

# Radix or Counting Sort: fixed length numbers that need to be sorted (money, bids, etc)
